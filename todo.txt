// ===== Documentation =====
// =========================

// Installation:
-- Install the theme manually by navigating from the root folder of your DNN installation to /Portals/_default/Skins and dropping the theme files in a folder named Triton.
-- Login to your DNN installations admin panel & apply the theme globally.

// Banners:
-- There are two banner panes built into the theme. One is at the top (TopBannerPane), and the other is at the bottom (BottomBannerPane);
-- These are useful design elements for creating call to actions. By default they are position relatively, but can be turned into fixed position elements
-- by applying the following data attribute: data-sticky="true"
-- Each banner needs the .banner class followed by either .banner--top or .banner--bottom depending on what banner you're using.
-- To add a close button create a div with the class .banner__close-button and use whatever you'd like as the icon inside (Typically Font Awesome).

// Header:
-- The header is positioned relatively by default but can be fixed by applying the data-attribute: data-sticky="true".
-- When this data-attribute is applied the header will stick to the top of the page (or under the top banner if that's set to sticky as well) when a user scrolls.
-- This is applied on both desktop and mobile. Support can be added in the future to only apply a fixed position on mobile instead of desktop & vice versa.

// Menu:
-- The menu accepts one data-attribute (data-dropdown-icon) to change the dropdown icon on both mobile & desktop. You can pass any Font Awesome icon class as the parameter to
-- the data-attribute.
-- ex. data-dropdown-icon="fas fa-angle-down"

// Images:
-- All images and background-images should be lazy loaded & provided at optimal sizes to improve the user experience. To dynamically load responsive images we need to supply images at different sizes. 
-- For sake of clarity we'll use small, medium, large when referring to image sizes.
-- A small image is anything less than 768px. If an image is small we only need to supply that image.
-- A medium image is anything greater than or equal to 768px and less than 1200px. If an image is medium we need to supply two versions of that image (small & medium).
-- A large image is anything greater or equal to 1200px. If an image is large we need to supply three versions of that image (small, medium & large).
-- Images can be lazy loaded by applying a .lazyload class to the <img> element.

// Accordion:
-- All accordions are initialized by default as long as the following structure is used and if the correct script imports are provided:

// Background Video:
--

// Counter:
--

// Slick (Slider/Carousel):
-- 

// Phone Numbers
-- By default phone numbers wrapped in an anchor tag will stay as they are. If you'd like to have them change their destination based screen width use the following function calls:
-- setNumber(number) - Accepts any phone number as a string. This will set the phone number you'd like to set as the destination on mobile.
-- setDestination(destination) - Accepts any valid URL as a string. This will set the desktop destination.
-- setBreakpoint(breakpoint) - Accepts any integer. By default this is set at 768. This will change the breakpoint where the destination will change.
